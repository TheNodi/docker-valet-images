# Docker Valet Test Images

This repository contains the `Dockerfiles` to build [valet-linux](https://github.com/cpriego/valet-linux/) test images.
Those machines are used to automatically test valet builds using CI tools (travis, jenkins, etc).

> **Important Note**: I use this images for testing in an isolated environment, they are NOT production-ready, use them at your own risk.
